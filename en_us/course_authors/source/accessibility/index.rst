Accessibility Best Practices Guidance for Content Providers
######################################################################

The core mission of edX is to expand access to education for everyone. We
expect courses and course content developed on the edX platform to be
accessible to everyone, regardless of any physical limitation that they might
have.

EdX is committed to incorporating accessibility into its platform, website
(http://www.edx.org), and mobile applications so that course providers can use
edX tools to develop accessible courses and course content that meets the
needs of all learners, including those with disabilities.

The topics in this section are intended to help course teams understand how to
develop courses that can serve the widest possible audience.

.. note:: Course teams should familiarize themselves with these best practice
   guidelines and distribute them to any members of their teams who are
   responsible for creating course content.
